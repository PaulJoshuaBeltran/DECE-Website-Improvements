Then, I completed and graduated my Masteral degree of Technology at Technological University of the Philippines (TUP- Manila) last March 2010. After taking this course, I applied as a full- time instructor with the same department and accepted as rank of a teaching Associate last June 2012. From that time I devoted some of my time of researching papers related to my field aside from teaching. The following researches which had already an ISSN numbers: Posicast Pulse Generation using LT Spice Simulations (October 18-19, 2012, ISSN 2094-0297), Security Systems from Remote Farm (September 20-24, 2013, ISSN 2301-3702), Surface Electromyography Signal for Control of Myoelecric Prosthesis of the Upper- Limb Using Independent Component Analysis (September 20-24, 2013, ISSN 2301-3702), Detection and Recognition of Faces from Still Images Utilizing Artificial Neural Networks November, 2013 not yet published from HNICEM but already accepted). Through this papers and well accepted evaluated, I promoted as Assistant Professor 1. I'm handling Electronics and Cmputer subjects and some Communications subjects. My focus of interest right now is to finish my PhD education here at DLSU- Manila and engaging most in Image Processing and Integrated Circuit design as my field of interests.</p>
